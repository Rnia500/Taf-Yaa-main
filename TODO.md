# TODO List for Fixing Tree Creation Error and Adding Navbar Link

## 1. Fix AudioUploadCard Context Issue
- [x] Modify `src/components/AudioUploadCard.jsx` to handle missing TreeProvider during tree creation, similar to FileUpload.jsx
- [x] Wrap `useTree()` in try-catch and set `treeId` to 'creating' when not in context

## 2. Add My Trees Link to AdminNavbar
- [x] Edit `src/components/navbar/AdminNavbar.jsx` to add "My Trees" item in profile submenu
- [x] Import TreePine icon from lucide-react
- [x] Add new submenu item with href: '/my-trees'
